# Things I want to know more about React Docs - lists and keys, The Spread Operator and How to Pass Functions Between Components 

# React Docs - lists and keys


What does .map() return?

**It return a new array**

If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?

you should build a collection of elements and includes them in JSX using {}.


Each list item needs a unique **Key**.


What is the purpose of a key?

**It help React to identify which items have changed and should to give the element inside array to give the elements a stable identity**

# The Spread Operator


What is the spread operator?

**Its an operator for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a function’s arguments.**

List 4 things that the spread operator can do.

1. Using Math functions
2. Copying an array
3. Concatenating or combining arrays
4. Using an array as arguments

Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.

Example of combine two arrays: 

```
const hello = {hello: "😋😛😜🤪😝"}
const world = {world: "🙂🙃😉😊😇🥰😍🤩!"}

const helloWorld = {...hello,...world}
console.log(helloWorld) // Object { hello: "😋😛😜🤪😝", world: "🙂🙃😉😊😇🥰😍🤩!" }
```


Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

Example of add new item to array:

``` const fruits = ['🍏','🍊','🍌','🍉','🍍']
const moreFruits = [...fruits];
console.log(moreFruits) // Array(5) [ "🍏", "🍊", "🍌", "🍉", "🍍" ]
fruits[0] = '🍑'
console.log(...[...fruits,'...',...moreFruits]) //  🍑 🍊 🍌 🍉 🍍 ... 🍏 🍊 🍌 🍉 🍍

  }
  
  ```



Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.


```
const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}
const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}
const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}
console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }
const objectFour = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: () => {console.log("😂".repeat(5))}}
objectFour.laugh() // 😂😂😂😂😂 
```




# How to Pass Functions Between Components


In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?

pass it like any other prompt and craete property the same name or not and passing the function using this inside it. and this is a refernce for the main function.

In your own words, what does the increment function do?
