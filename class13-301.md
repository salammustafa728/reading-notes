In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:
   100’s = **These are informational status codes; used usually to tell the client that the header part of the request has been received and the server will try to comply with a transmission demand of the client.**
      
   200’s = **These are the success codes. They tell the client that its request was accepted**
   
   300’s =**These are redirection codes. Uesd to tell the client that the resource they are requesting isn’t available at the expected location anymore.**
   
   400’s = **These are the client error codes. They are all about invalid requests a client sent to a server. There are several causes to this, timeouts, wrong URI, missing authentication, etc. **
   
   500’s = **These are the server error codes. they indicate problems with overwhelmed servers or unreachable servers behind proxies, but sometimes they can be directly related to client requests that trigger error exceptions on the server**
