SQL                        |  NoSQL
----                       | -------
primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS) | primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
----                       | -------
table based databases      | document based
 ----                      | -------
have predefined schema     | have dynamic schema for unstructured data
----                       | -------
uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data  | queries are focused on collection of documents
----                       | ------
examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. | examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb
----                       | ------
good fit for the complex query intensive environment | nvironment whereas NoSQL databases are not good fit for complex queries.
----                       | ------
