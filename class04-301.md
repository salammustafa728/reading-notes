# React Docs - Forms

What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

**It's HTML elements like `<input>, <textarea>, and <select>` that updates its own state based on user input. In React mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with setState().**



Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why?.

**we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them because because you need to write an event handler for every way your data can change and
It is used controlled component.** 


How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

**you can add a name attribute to each element and let the handler function choose what to do based on the value of event.target.name.**


# The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained


Why would we use a ternary operator?

**Because it shorten your if statements into one line of code with the conditional operator**



Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

`      if(x===y){
     console.log(true);
      } else {
     console.log(false);
      }
`

**My solution**

```
 x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false);
```
