## Things I want to know more about Functional Programming Concepts and Node JS


### Functional Programming Concepts


What is functional programming?

**It is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data**

What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

**A pure function: It returns the same result if given the same arguments, Pure functions are stable, consistent, and predictable. Given the same parameters, pure functions will always return the same result.**

What are the benefits of a pure function?
    
**The code’s of pure function is definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything.**

What is immutability?
    
**Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.**    


What is Referential transparency?

**It's a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.**


### Node JS 


What is a module?

**We seperate our code into modules when we write a code and module is counted things for us, and is a javascript file**

What does the word ‘require’ do?

**It makes the variables global so we can use it everywhere**
    
How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
    
**By export the module the part from the module that you want to be available from the module and put require in the other module that you want to use it inside.**    
    
What do we have to do to make a module available?

**first export it then require it inside a variable**
