# Arrays
special type of variables it's store a list of values.
It's helpful when you don't know the number of item the list will contain.
**creating an array** 
* just like any variable you should give it a name and using the var keyword.
* The values that assigned to the array must be inside a squre backets and seperated by comma.
     * you can make array literal like this colors= ['white',
              'black',
              'custom']; in seperate lines.
      * array constructor: This uses the new
        keyword followed by Array();The values are then specified in parentheses (not square brackets).
  examples of arrays: 
  -   var colors;
       colors ['white', 'black', ' custom '];
- var el document.getElementByld('col ors');
       el . textContent = col ors[O];
- var colors new Array('white ' ,
                    'black',
                    'custom ' );
- var el = document.getElementByid( ' co lors ' );
      el.innerHTML = colors.item(O);

*Values in array* the value accessed like they accessed in numbered list, and it numbering, the start are from zero. each item in the array given a number called index, this can be use to access the specific item.  
*Expresstions* we have tow type:
* expression that just assign a value, like:
   var color = 'beige';
* expression that use tow or more value to return a single value, like: var area = 3 * 2;

*Functions* It's let you to group a series of statment together to perform a specific task.
when you make a function you need to give it a name to call it when you need it and if you want to ask the function to perform its task later.
And function may have paremeter or not, so the function had a return function.
