# Readings : Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

# HTML Tables
**A table represents information in a grid format. Example of tables financial reports**

The basic structure of Table:
`<table>` tag used to create a table.
`<tr>` to create a rows.
`<td>`The td stands for table data the number of cells represented by it.

If you want to put a headings to the table The `<th>` element is used for that.And table have colspan tage is used for on a `<th>` or `<td>` element and indicates how many columns that cell should run across. And the rowspan used on a `<th>` or `<td>` element to indicate how many rows a cell should span down the table. And you have `<thead>` tag it used to put the heading of the table inside it. `<tbody>` to put the body inside it. `<tfoot>` to put the footer inside it.  

>You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.

>For long tables you can split the table into a `<thead>,<tbody>, and <tfoot>.`

# Object-Oriented Programming

**Objects** Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model.
- In object varaibles become known as properties.
- In object functios become known as methods.

Creating Literal Object: ITs the popular way to define an object.

You can access properites and methods object by dot notation.

Creating object constructor notation.
The **new** keyword you can use it to create a blank object. And if you want to update the value inside the object you can use the dot notation or square brackets.
And to delete a property use delete keyword.

Sometimes you want several objects to represent similar things. This called create instance of the object. You can create object by using constrctor syntax.

The keyword **this** is commonly used inside functions and objects.

In JavaScript, data is represented using name/value pairs. To organize your data, you can use an array or object to group a set of related values.

Arrays are an object also, its special type of object.
You can combine arrays and objects to create a complex data structure.

Built-in objects: Browsers come with a set of built-in objects that represent things like browser window. There is three type of built-in object:

- Browser object model: contains objects that represent the current browser window or tab.

- Document object model: The Document Object Model uses
objects to create a representation of the current page.

![DOM](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/DOM-model.svg/1200px-DOM-model.svg.png)

- Global JavaScript object: The global JavaScript objects represent things that the JavaScript language needs to create a model of.

**Data Type** we have six type of data type 
- Number 
- String
- Boolean
- Undefiend
- Null
- object

The Math object has properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions. And it's a global
object, you can just use the name of the Math object followed by the property or method you want to access.
And we can use it to create a random number.

Create instance of date object then you can specify the time and date that yoy want it to represent.
