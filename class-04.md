# Readings : HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

# HTML Links 

Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another.

You hava a lot of ways to use links:
* Links from one website to another.
* Links from one page to another on the same website.
* Links from one part of a web page to another part of the same page.
* Links that open in a new browser window.
* Links that start up your email program and address a new email to someone.

>The `<a>` element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.

>You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.

>You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.

# Intro to CSS Layout

Building Blocks: CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.

   * Block-level elements start on a new line
     Examples include:
       `<h1> <p> <ul> <li>`
   * Inline elements flow in between surrounding text Examples include:
           `<img> <b> <i>`


**Containing Elements** If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.       

**Controll ing the Position of El ements**
In CSS we have positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page like: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.

* Normal flow Every block-level element appears on a new line, causing each item to appear lower down the page than the previous one.

* Relative Positioning: This moves an element from the position it would be in normal
flow, shifting it to the top, right, bottom, or left of where it would have been placed.

* Ab solute positioning: This positions the element in relation to its containing element. It is taken out of normal flow.

**box offset** It's a properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom and left or right it should be placed.
* Fixed Positioning: This is a form of absolute
positioning that positions the element in relation to the browser window, as opposed to the containing element.

* Floating Elements: Floating an element allows
you to take that element out of normal flow and position it to the far left or right of a containing box.

>Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

>Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.

>Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling.

>Grids help create professional and flexible designs.

# JS Functions

FUNCTIONS & METHODS: Allow you to group a set of related statements that represent a specific task.
*Functions* can take parameters aand may return value.


OBJECTS: n object that have a series of varaibles and function that represent something.


 BUILT-IN:  *JavaScript* have built-in object like: String, Number, Math, Date.



**Example for declaring a function**

**pair programming** 
pair programming involve two two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the one whose only his hands are on the keyboard. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.

Pair programming have skills:
- Greater efficiency
- Engaged collaboration
- Social skills
