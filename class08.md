# Readings : CSS Layout

# CSS

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.

In block level, If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.

Type of position we have three type of position element:
* Normal flow Every block-level element appears on a new line, causing each item to appear lower down the page than the previous one.

* Relative Positioning: This moves an element from the position it would be in normal
flow, shifting it to the top, right, bottom, or left of where it would have been placed.

* Absolute positioning: This positions the element in relation to its containing element. It is taken out of normal flow. 

* Fixed Positioning: This is a form of absolute
positioning that positions the element in relation to the browser window, as opposed to the containing element.

* Floating Elements: Floating an element allows
you to take that element out of normal flow and position it to the far left or right of a containing box.

* Static position: it's the default position for most elemet in html.

* Overlapping element you can use z-index to overlap the element.

* float property: The float property allows you
to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible. you can use it to make the elements next to each other.

Screen resolution: refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch.and you can control it by css.

To control screen sizes and display resolutions, many web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide

A Liquid Layout: uses percentages to specify the width
of each box so that the design will stretch to fit the size of the screen.

Layout Grids: you can use a grid structure to help them
position items on a page.
Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
