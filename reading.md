***Reading-notes for Monday 29-mar-2021***



**What I had learnt today.**

**Choosing A Text Editor:**
 The artical tells us how to choose a good text editor the writer tried a lot of tex editors, he think it is truly  matters as to which text editor you use. And the best text editor is what we can deal with it good.

**Text editor** is a sostware we can download and install it from the internet on our computer or we can use it online  through our web browser, also it allows us to write and manage text.

There is a lot of features fo text editors, the most features that uses is 1.) code completion; 2.) syntax
highlighting; 3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
fatigue); and 4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them.

In our devices we have text editors that are already installed like notepad in windows. And on Linux computers, each distribution will have its own text the editor already installed. And there is a software that you can install it from the internet like Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom,
Brackets, and Sublime Text.

**The command line** when You enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.
 there is a lot of command line you can use in terminal like this   ->      ls -l /home/ryan 
( ls ) Typically a command is always the first thing you type

**The Difference Between Text
Editors and IDEs**
*A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the titleâ€”it edits text
*An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) it is an editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.


**Navigation:** 
***The commands:***
* pwd which stands for Print Working Directory
* ls It's short for list. We can write it in different ways 
* ls  ls in it's most basic form. It listed the contents of our current directory
* ls -l  which indicates we are going to do a long listing
*  ls -l /etc  When we do this it tells ls not to list our current directory but instead to list that directories contents.
* ~  This is a shortcut for your home directory.
* . (dot) - This is a reference to your current directory
* .. (dotdot)- This is a reference to the parent directory.
* cd which stands for change directory.

**Files**
**The common extensions of files:**
* file.exe - an executable file, or program.
* file.txt - a plain text file.
* file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.

---------------------------------------------------



***note:***
* the operating system is case sensitive. 
* the spaces in file name is valid but we need to be careful, we can use quotes to called a file that has a space in it's name. Also we can use escap character which is a backslash ( \ ) What the backslash does is escape (or nullify) the special meaning of the next character.
* file: obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.
* ls -a :List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.
* Everything is a file under Linux even directories.
* Linux is an extensionless system
* Files can have any extension they like or none at all.
* Linux is case sensitive
