**The Basic of HTML page structure**


![htmltags](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wVgenPKD0uY/VtkzZZNAStI/AAAAAAAAH9Q/QfufBVUNEiQ/s1600/htmltags.jpg)


**Headings:**
You ca add a headings in your HTML code by using `h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6` HTML has six level of headings you can use h1 for the biggest size of font and h2 for less and so on. 
`<h1>` is used for main headings
`<h2>` is used for subheadings.


**Paragraphs:** You can use `<p>` tag to add a paragraph to your webpage 


**Bold & It alic** By usung `<b>` tag you can make
characters appear bold. And tag `<i>` to make
characters appear italic.

**Superscript & Subscript** You can use `<sup>` tag to contain characters that should be superscript. like the suffixes of dates.
And you can use `<sub>` to contain characters that should be subscript. Like chemical
formulas such as H20.

**White Space** Webpage allows adding extra spaces or start some elements on new lines. 


**Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules** You can use `<br />` to make a new line. And if you wanted
to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag `<br />`.
And you can use `<hr />` to create a break between
themes. like such as a change of topic in a book.


***Visual Editors & Their Code views***

**Visual Editors** It's a word processors you can use it to change the type of font bold or italic ,line breaks, horizontal rules or Headings 

**Code views:** It show you the code created by the visual editor.


**Semantic Markup** 
It's not effect the structure but add extra information to the pages.
* `<em>` that allows you to indicate where emphasis
should be placed on selected words.
* And `<blockquote>`indicates that a block of text is a quotation.

* The `<strong>` used for indicates that its
content has strong importance. The content will be in bold style.
 
* `<q>` It is used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph.

* `<abbr>` It is used A title attribute on the opening tag is used to specify the full term.

* `<cite>` indicate where the citation is from.

* `<dfn>` use to explain some new terminology.

* `<address>` use to contain contact details for the author of the page.

* The `<ins>` element can be used to show content that has been inserted into a document.

* The `<del>` element can show text that has been deleted from it.

* The `<s>` element indicates something that is no longer accurate or relevant.

> HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page.



# CSS

CSS is the presentation of your work. The design to your web pages. It's control how to color texts, fonts and backgroung also how to control the position of the elements on the screen.

![css_ex](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9461/css-declaration-small.png)

*CSS* selectors are case sensitive,so they must match element names and attribute values exactly.

There is a three ways to put css into your code
* Inline: it's by using the style attribute inside HTML elements

* Internal: it's by using a `<style>` element in the `<head>` section

* External: it's by using a `<link>` element to link to an external CSS file. and it's the best way to write css code. because all element will be the same.

**Inheritance** If you specify the font-family
or color properties on the `<body>` element, they will apply to most child elements. This is
because the value of the font-family property is
inherited by child elements.



# JavaScript

JavaScript it makes the webpages interactive, interesting, and user-friendly.
You can see JS inside HTML inside `<script></script>`.

**OBJECTS** In computer programming, each physical thing in the world can be represented as an object

**Methods** represent things people need to do with objects. The code for a method can contain lots of instructions that together represent one task.

>The HTML `<script>` element is used in HTML pages
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like the `<link>` element can be used to load a CSS file).

**Date object**
it will contain the date and time when the JavaScript interpreter encounters that line of code.

![Date](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--rPMZRrt2--/c_imagga_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_720,q_auto,w_1280/https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/gy7wqpzb7skxdo5jfwn4.png)

Example of Method and Object 

![method](https://miro.medium.com/max/2056/1*SPZnQAWqfvZSCz4Y4rzyzg.png)

>Functions allow you to group a set of related
statements together that represent a single task.

>In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object.

>JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.


**Conditional statemants** it's for make decision and check the status of the script.
And based on *if/else* if the condition met then your code will excutes one or more statement else it will skip or do another statements.


**If-Statement** provide two set of code:
      * if the condition is true. 
      * if the condition is false.

![ifelsestatement](https://miro.medium.com/max/1968/1*uENzVnU4d_rXpuoe9q1jsw.png)

**Switch-Statement** begin with a variable called switch value and each case have a possible value for this variable. The code run if the variable matches the value.

 # **Comparison Operators** 
You can use it to comparing value to what it should be in a situation.
* == It's means equal to it's comparing two value to see if they are the same.
* === Strict equal to: to check two values are the same data type and the value are the same.

  ![equalTo](https://i.stack.imgur.com/5ttlR.png)

* Not equal to != you can use it to compare two value to see if they are not the same.

* !== Strict not equal to to check two values are the same data type and the value are not the same.
