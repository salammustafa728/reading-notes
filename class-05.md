# Images

To make our website more attractive we put imges.

Images can be used to set the tone for a site in less time than it takes to read a description.

If you want to add Images for Your Site you must be sure if the image not stock.

If you are building a site from scratch, it is good practice to create a folder for all of the images the site uses.
To add image you can add it by using `<img>` tag 
and you must put the src and the alt if you want and you can change its width and hieght

We have a three rules for adding images:

1. Save images in the right format.
2. Save images at the right size.
3. Use the correct resolution.


You can use GIF or PNG format when saving images
with few colors or large areas of the same color.And we can use vector images and animated GIFs 

You should be sure about the resolution it should be a resolution of 72 ppi.

>You can use a background image behind the box
created by any element on a page.

>To reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites.


**Color**

**Foreground-color** it specify the text color
there is three ways to specify the colors:
* **RGB Values** express color in which red, green and blue are used to make it up. it' range from 0-255
* **Hex Codes** it's six-digit code begin with #
 tag then six mix number and digts. 
* **Color-Names** you can use the color name, there is a 147 predifind color in *css* .

* *Hue* it's how the color have saturation and brightness. It's values 0 t0 360.
* *Saturation* it's the amount of gray in the color. It represent as 100% to 0% is the gray shade. 
* *Brightness* it's refer to how much black in the color. 
* *Contrast* it's the space between the background and the foreground and it's make the text more readable for the user.
* *Opacity* to specify the opacity of an element and any of it's child element. it's value from 0.0 to 1.0.
* *HSL* : using the hue, saturation and lightness values.

**Text**

The properties that allow you to control the appearance of text can be split intotwo groups:
* Those that directly affect t ●● he font and its appearance.
* Those that would have the same effect on text no matter what font you were using (including the color of text and the spacing between words and letters).

**JPEG vs PNG vs GIF**
- Use JPEG format for the images that have natural scene or photograph where variation in colour and intensity is smooth.
- Use PNG format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos.
- Use GIF format for images that contain animations.

**Compression** can be of two types — lossless and lossy. In lossless compression, it is possible to reconstruct the original image from the compressed image because there is no information loss during compression. Lossy compression algorithms always have a superior compression ratio.JPEG is a lossy compression. PNG is a lossless image format using DEFLATE compression. GIF is also a lossless image format that uses LZW compression algorithm.
